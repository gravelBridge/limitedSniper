# limitedSniper
A Roblox Limited Item Sniper written in Python


How To Use:
Install the latest version of Python from python.org
Open config.json with your favorite text editor.

In the itemIDsToSnipe tab, please go into the brackets and put the itemIds that you want to snipe in.
The more items you place, the more proxies you will need.

In the pricesToBuyIDsAtInSameOrder tab, please insert the prices that you would like to buy the above items at IN THE SAME ORDER.
Example: "itemIDsToSnipe": [129349832492384],
         "pricesToBuyIDsAtInSameOrder": [30]
         
This will buy the item id 129349832492384 when the price reaches 30 robux or below.

In the cookie tab, insert your Roblox Cookie. (.ROBLOSECURITY)

In the rotating proxy URL, insert your rotating proxy URL. For webshare, it looks something like this: "http://ligmarfh-rotate:zyij45g2g13d@p.webshare.io:80/"

In order to get the best performance, get proxies that are in the same country as you and get a vps that has low ping to Roblox servers.
